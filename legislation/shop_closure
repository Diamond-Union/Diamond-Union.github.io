# THE SHOP CLOSURE BILL

### ARTICLE 1: THE SHOP
All shops that close must tell the Diamond Union if they are expecting a 2.0 so that seats can be reserved. If they are not expecting a 2.0 then the shop in question must state that.

### ARTICLE 2: THE MEMBERS
The members of the shop and the members of other shops must respect this decision.

### ARTICLE 3: THE OWNERSHIP
If the shop owner resigns but they are going to pass on the ownership to another person, then the shop must state that to the Diamond Union and any reshuffling of their representatives for their seats in the House.
