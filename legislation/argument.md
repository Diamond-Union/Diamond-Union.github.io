# THE ARGUMENT BILL

### ARTICLE 1: ARGUMENTS VERSUS DEBATES
A debate is a discussion (usually with opposing ideas) between 2 people. It is constructive and it has a purpose. However, an argument has little to no purpose and may start a flame war.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTROLLED ARGUMENTS
If an argument has started, it may only go on for 30 posts, or 1 and a half pages and be semi-constructive. If it exceeds this then Article 3 will come into play.

### ARTICLE 3: PUNISHMENT
If an argument has exceeded 30 posts and the parties refuse to stop the argument, then a punishment will be given that is decided on by the executive branch.

### ARTICLE 4: THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
Arguments will not be dealt with by the House of representatives as shops may be biased. They will be dealt with by the Executive branch.

### ARTICLE 5: THE LAST RESORT
In the unlikely event that all of these don't work, then the posts will be reported to the Scratch Team.
